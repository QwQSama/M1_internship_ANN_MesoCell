All projects are built in the conda environment. 
I have placed my environment files here, to reproduce my environment, run the following code after installing anaconda:

conda env create -f environment_base.yml

conda avtivate <environment_name>

I have categorized the final version of the files for neat viewing. 
However, the synchronization changes have not been made in the notebook, 
to make it work, you need to change the address of the files or put them in a folder.
